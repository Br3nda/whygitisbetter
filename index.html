	        <h2>Cheap Local Branching</h2>
					<div class="contents">
						
						<div class="text">
							Probably Git's most compelling feature that really makes it stand
							apart from nearly every other SCM out there is it's branching
							model.  It is completely different from all of the models I'm 
							comparing it to here, most of which recommend that the best branch
							is basically a clone of the repository in a new directory.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							Git does not work like that.  Git will allow you to have multiple
							local branches that can be entirely independent of each other and
							the creation, merging and deletion of those lines of development
							take seconds.
						</div>
						
						
						<div class="text">
							This means that you can do things like :
							<ul>
								<li>Create a branch to try out an idea, commit
									a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, 
									switch back to where you are experimenting, then merge it in.
								</li>
								<li>Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production,
									another that you merge work into for testing and several smaller
									ones for day to day work
								</li>
								<li>Create new branches for each new feature you're working on, so
									you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete
									each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
								</li>
								<li>Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to
									work and just delete it, abandoning the work - with nobody else
									ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						
						<img src="images/branches.png">
						
						<div class="text">
							Importantly, when you push to a remote repository, you do <em>not</em>
							have to push all of your branches.  You can only share one of your
							branches and not all of them.  This tends to free people to try
							new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when they
							are going to merge it in or share it with others.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							You <em>can</em> find ways to do some of this with other systems, but the work
							involved is much more difficult and error-prone.  Git makes this
							process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers
							work when they learn it.
						</div>

	        <h2>Everything is Local</h2>
					<div class="contents">	

						<div class="text">
							This is basically true of all the distributed SCMs, but in my
							experience even more so with Git.  There is very little outside
							of 'fetch', 'pull' and 'push' that communicates in any way with 
							anything other than your hard disk.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							Even in Mercurial, common commands like 'incoming' and 'outgoing' hit 
							the server, where with Git you can 'fetch' all the servers data
							before going offline and do comparisons, merges and logs of data
							that is on the server but not in your local branches yet.
						</div>
						
						<div class="text">
							This means that it's very easy to have copies of not only your
							branches, but also of everyones branches that are working with
							you in your Git repository without having to mess your own stuff
							up.
						</div>

	        <h2>Git is Fast</h2>
	
					<div class="contents">
						<div class="text">
							Git is fast.  Everyone, even most of the hard core users of these
							other systems generally give Git this title.  Compared to SVN and
							Perforce this is somewhat because all operations are done locally.
							However, even compared to the other DSCMs, Git it pretty fast. 
						</div>
					
						<div class="text">
							Part of this is likely because it was built to work on the Linux 
							kernel, which means that it has had to deal effectively with large
							repositories from day one.
							Another reason is that Git is written in C, and yet another reason
							is that the primary developers are, in my experience, very very 
							preoccupied with this.

					<div class="contents">

							actually smaller (apparently a lot can go in those .svn dirs).

					There are other services, but few are user-oriented or socially
					targeted, and none have near the user-base.  This social aspect
					is killer.
